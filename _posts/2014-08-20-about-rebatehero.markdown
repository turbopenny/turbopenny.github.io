Rebate Hero is a comprehensive clearinghouse for rebate offers. We have scoured print and online resources to find rebates that can save you money on every day items or once-in-a-lifetime purchases. Whether you are new to rebates, or an old hand, our goal is to make it easy for you to find and submit the ones you can use.

The founders of Rebate Hero have saved money for years with rebates. When we were young, rebate offers were posted on the bulletin board at the entrance to the grocery store. The Rebate Hero website is an online version of that bulletin board, making it easy for shoppers to find rebates they can actually use, and helping with the sometimes confusing process of submitting the rebate forms.

Corporations offer rebates to drive sales and gather marketing information. Consumers can use rebates to get significant savings on small and large purchases. Consumers have to make an effort to get the savings, first finding the rebate and then submitting the rebate forms. This can seem overwhelming, but a small effort can result in big savings. Rebate Hero wants to make the process nearly effortless to help you get into the “rebate habit.”

There are so many rebate offers that it can be hard to find the ones that will do you the most good. That's why Rebate Hero puts so much thought and effort into gathering and presenting our comprehensive list of rebates. Whether you are a novice or a pro, an online or offline shopper, contemplating a large or small purchase, we offer tools that will make it easy for you to find the rebates that will save you real money.

##About Rebates

Rebates encourage customers to buy by promising cash or other reward back after purchase. Rebates, unlike coupons, are usually not redeemed at checkout, but only after the sale is complete. Corporations offer rebates to drive sales and gather marketing information. Consumers use rebates to get significant savings, but the effort of finding the offers and submitting the forms can discourage people from claiming the money they deserve.

RebateHero.com makes the process nearly effortless by gathering and organizing a comprehensive database of rebates and giving you powerful tools to pinpoint and track the offers you can really use. Every listing shows what is on offer; where you can find it;  how much you will save; when, how, and what to submit to successfully redeem the rebate. You will no longer leave money on the table with RebateHero.com as your ally.

Whether you are a novice or a pro, an online or offline shopper, contemplating a large or small purchase, RebateHero.com makes it easy for you to find and redeem the rebates that will save you real money.
